Hey Everyone!

Last week was even duller. I didn't get any time to work on the new flag --committer-date-is-author-date. My mentors and I, all were busy with travelling and other stuff. But I discovered that setting GIT_COMMITTER_DATE environment variable through the code will not affect committer date during interactive rebase. The week ended with two more rounds of review of my earlier [patch][1]. The good news is that my patch is now in Junio's [tree][2]! And soon it will be merged in the main [git/git][3] repository.

## ## Other Stuff

Remember that [foo.bar][4] challenge? Dude, it is real! I received a mail from the Google Staffing! Who knows I might fetch an internship at Google for real! I am very excited.

Thanks!
