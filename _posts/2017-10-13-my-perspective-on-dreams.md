> You mustn’t be afraid to dream a little bigger, Darling <br> --**Inception (2010)**

As a child, we all have dreams, aspirations, unimaginable feats we’re unrealistically trying to achieve. Why is it that when we’re young, we’re so imaginative and willing to believe? Is it because we are still so innocent? What happens between childhood and adulthood that makes us all forget who we really are?

Maybe it’s this ideology that we’ve all taken up as a coping mechanism. Don’t expect much and you won’t be disappointed. Maybe it’s the realities of life that make us push aside what we really want just to get by.

That’s the process that I find most unfortunate of all processes in life. There’s this ever encompassing idea that dreams can be too big for one individual to handle. We’d rather give up and settle than run that extra mile. We’re distracted by things we think we need and when we are unable to grasp it, our world goes away from the usual course.

_“Everything is wrong, but nothing is really wrong.”_

The difference between childhood and adulthood is the ability to put your dreams into actions. The child inside you **believes**….. while the adult inside you **acts**. If it’s just one life that we have now….. it’s everything in between that makes it a **great ending**.
