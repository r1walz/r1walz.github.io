> It is often stated that of all the theories proposed in this century, the silliest is the quantum theory. In fact, some say that the only thing that quantum theory has going for it is that it is unquestionably correct. <br> --**Michio Kaku**

Nature, including molecules and everything, follows laws of quantum mechanics, a branch of physics that explores how the physical world works at most fundamental level. At this very small level, everything behaves in a very strange way, taking on more than one “State” at the same time, and interacting with some other “entangled” particle extremely far away. Quantum computing harness these quantum phenomena to process information.

Classical computers store information in “bits”. Bit stands for binary digit, i.e., 1 or 0 that acts as on/off switches that ultimately runs the computer. Quantum computers on the other hand stores information in form of “qubits” – quantum bit, which operates according to two key principles of quantum mechanics; superposition and entanglement. Superposition means that a qubit can be both 1 and 0 at the same time. And entanglement means that if we know the state of one qubit we can determine the state of the other with absolute certainty. Using these principles qubits can act as more sophisticated switches enabling quantum computers to function in ways that seem impossible for now such as telling weather with absolute certainty, even predicting future!

Such claims may seem like fairy tales but there is development going in this field. Google, Microsoft, and other tech giants are working to make this a reality, developing real-life model. Although the results are not very satisfying but someday, that is not very far, we will have very high computing power than we ever had.
